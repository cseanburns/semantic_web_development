# HTML5 and The Web

In chapter two, we focus on learning HTML5.
The goal is to cover:

- Document structure
- Text content and inline semantics
- Images and multimedia
- Tables and forms

In this chapter, I want you to focus solely on learning HTML5.
Do not attempt to apply any CSS to your content.
This of course means that your web content will appear bland, but that's okay.
We want to learn one thing at a time and take the time to learn that one thing.

## Your Work

As we learn this material, you will do the following:

- Create files in your local repository that modify the lessons covered here.
- Push your files to GitHub.
- In GitHub, build your own website using the skills you learn in this chapter.
- Remember, use HTML5 only. We'll apply CSS3 in the next chapter.
