# CSS3 and Web Design

We use HTML to structure our web pages and sites and to add content.
HTML5's semantic elements help enrich the meaning of our page structures and content.
However, we do not use HTML for presentation, layout, and style.
Rather, we use CSS for these things.
This idea, that we [separate content from presentation][separation_wiki], is key characteristic of web development.
In this chapter, we explore how to use CSS3 to style our sites.
We will learn how to use CSS to add color, change font styles, style tables and images, and most interestingly, to arrange a page's layout.
