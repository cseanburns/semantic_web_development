# CSS3 and Web Design

HTML provides structure and content for web pages.
It defines elements like sections, headings, paragraphs, and links.
HTML5 adds semantic elements, and these elements enhance the meaning and accessibility of our content.
However, HTML is not responsible for presentation, layout, or style.
This is the roll of CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets.

A fundamental principle of modern web development is the [separate content from presentation][separation_wiki].
The idea is to use HTML to focus on structure and CSS on styling.
By doing so, we create cleaner, more maintainable, and more adaptable web designs.

In this chapter, we'll explore how to use CSS3 to add visual appeal and layouts to our web pages and sites.
We will cover techniques for adding color, customizing fonts, styling images and tables, and most importantly,
arranging page layouts with CSS.
