# Typography and Font Styles

The *typography* of a document is generally its most visible aspect.
This is true regardless if the document is a web page, a book, a billboard, or a flyer.
We use typographic principles to shape how text is presented, read, and interpreted.

In web development, typography is important because it influences the user experience.
It affects readability, aesthetics, and accessibility, and
it plays a central role in how content is presented across different screen sizes and devices.

In all, good typography can:

- improve readability and legibility
- establish identity and tone
- enhance user engagement
- maximize accessibility for users, and this includes those with visual impairments
- contribute to an intuitive and pleasant user experience

## Key Concepts in Typography

Typography consists of several elements that determine how text appears.
These elements include:

- `font-family`: this is the specific typeface or group of typefaces. Major typefaces include: `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`
- `font-style`: this includes variations like normal, italic, or oblique
- `font-weight`: this addresses the thickness of characters and ranges from light to bold
- `font-size`: this consists of the height of characters. It can be set in fixed or relative units, and it alters the content-size of its box
- `letter-spacing`, or kerning: this addresses the spacing between individual letters
- `line-height`: this addresses the spacing between lines of text
- `text-align`: this addresses the horizontal alignment of text and is used to center or justify text
- `text-indent`: this addresses the indentation of text

## Typography vs. Fonts

[Typography][typography_wiki] refers to the overall design and arrangement of text.
It includes the choice of fonts, how fonts are spaced and aligned, and other readability considerations.

In CSS, and thus in practice, we largely work with properties related to **fonts**.
Fonts are specific styles or variations of [typefaces][typeface_wiki] (aka, font families).
In short, typography is the art of arranging text,
while fonts are the specific tools used in that arrangement.

## Basic Typography Principles

The goal of typography is to improve readability.
This is accomplished by creating web pages and sites that are visually appealing.
The following key principles help achieve that goal:

- **Readability and legibility**: Use appropriate font choices, sizes, and spacing to make sure that text is easy to read.
- **Hierarchy**: Implement variations in font size, weight, and color because it will help establish structure and guide the reader's attention.
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniformity in the typographic elements, such as font families, alignment, and spacing, you use to create a cohesive design.
- **Alignment and balance**: Arrange text in a consistent and structured way. This includes properties like left alignment, centering, and justifying. This will help maintain visual balance and improve reading comprehension.
- **Contrast**: Differentiate headings, body text, and other elements through the use of font weight, font size, and font color. This will help make content more engaging.
- **White space (or negative space)**: Use adequate spacing around text. This will help avoid clutter and improve readability.

## Font Families

Of all the typographic elements above, the one with the most impact is the `font-family`.
The major font families include `serif`, `sans-serif`, and `monospace`, but [there are more][font_families_w3].
We select font families based on several criteria:

- **Serif fonts**: these are typefaces that have decorative strokes, or *serifs*, at the ends of letters. Common examples include Times New Roman and Georgia. These kinds of typefaces are commonly used in print and they convey a classic, professional look.
- **Sans-serif fonts**: these fonts lack (*sans*) serifs or decorations. These fonts convey cleaner and more modern designs. Common examples include Arial, Helvetica, and Verdana. They benefit digital content because they augment clarity and readability on screens in particular.
- **Monospace fonts**: the characters in these fonts take up the same amount of horizontal space. Examples include Courier New and Consolas. These font families are typically used in coding environments or to display code in web documents because they make it easier to align characters and read structured text.

## Typography in Web Development

Web developers and designers use CSS to control typography across different devices and screen sizes.
The goal is to always make sure that text is legible and visually appealing.
While this section covers the basics, typography is a big subject.
Entire books are dedicated to typography, and companies spend lots of resources on developing and using good fonts
because fonts play an important role in brand identity.
However, as you begin to use and then understand typography principles,
you will be able to use these principles to augment content and enhance user experience.

## Typography in Practice

### Font Family

We normally declare the `font-family` in the `html` or `body` selector.
When we declare a `font-family`, we provide a list of families.
Based on our operating systems, our browsers select the font to display by first available.
Therefore, we place the main, desired font at the beginning of the list but
then provide fallback fonts in case the main font is unavailable in the reader's browser.

In the following example, `Arial` is the font we ideally want to use in our web document, but
if this isn't available, then the browser falls back to the generic `sans-serif` font family.
For consistency, be sure to include fonts from the same family in this list
(e.g., all serif, all sans-serif, or all monospace but not a mix).

```
body {
    font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
}
```

#### Note on Examples Below

In the examples below, I use classes to demonstrate how to implement font and other properties.
In the first example, I use the class selector `.italic-text`.
This is implemented in HTML with the `class` attribute.
For example, if I want to italicize several words in a paragraph in my HTML,
I could use a `<span>` element with a `class` attribute of `italic-text`:

```
<p>This <span class="italic-text">text is italicized</span>.</p>
```

This would render as:

This *text is italicized.*

### Font Styles

We use the [`font-style`][font_style_w3m] to designate whether a font should be `normal`, `italic`, or `oblique`.

```
.italic-text {
    font-style: italic;
}

.oblique-text {
    font-style: oblique;
}
```

We can also control the slope of the font by setting a value for degrees (`deg`):

```
.oblique-text {
    font-style: oblique 10deg;
}
```

Note that in HTML, we can use the [`<i>`][i_mdn] or [`<em>`][em_mdn] elements
to add some kind of emphasis to our text that generally renders it as italicized text.
It's generally worthwhile to use these HTML elements when the reason for the emphasis has a semantic purpose.

### Font Weight

We use the [`font-weight`][font_weight_w3] property to thickness of the font, or its boldness.
Since font thickness is defined numerically, we can specify a range of weights, from light to heavy.

```
.light-text {
    font-weight: 200; /* Thin */
}

.bold-text {
    font-weight: bold; /* Equivalent to 700 */
}

.extra-bold-text {
    font-weight: 900; /* Heavy weight */
}
```

In HTML, we can use the [`<b>`][b_mdn] or [`<strong>`][strong_mdn] elements to render text as bold.
Again, unless there is some semantic reason to do so, use the CSS `font-weight` property instead.

### Font Size and Scaling

It's a good idea to clarify the default `font-size` in the `html` selector, and
then modify font-sizes throughout the document with respect to that.

```
html {
    font-size: 1rem;
}
```

However, we can also implement different font-sizes throughout the document:

```
.normal-text {
    font-size: 16px; /* Fixed size */
}

.relative-text {
    font-size: 1.2em; /* Relative to parent element */
}

.responsive-text {
    font-size: 3vw; /* Viewport width-based */
}
```

### Letter and Word Spacing

We have two properties to control the spacing between either letters or words.
This kind of property, generally referred to as [kerning][kerning_wiki], can augment readability.
However, be careful implementing this property.
Most typefaces have been designed with default kerning parameters, and
the basic font families have been well tested for readability.

```
.kerning-example {
    letter-spacing: 2px; /* Adjusts letter spacing */
}

.word-spacing-example {
    word-spacing: 5px; /* Adjusts space between words */
}
```

### Line Properties and Text Layout

The `line-height` property adjusts the spacing between lines.
Like kerning, be conservative when applying this property since it may impact legibility.
In the following example, we use a class (`.line-height-example`), but this for the kind of property,
we might want to apply it consistently by applying to one specific element, such as the `<p>` element.

```
.line-height-example {
    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjusts leading */
}
```

We can `center` or `justify` text with the `text-align` property:

```
.centered-text {
    text-align: center;
}

.justified-text {
    text-align: justify;
}
```

We can use the `text-indent` property to indent only the first line of an element.
This is especially useful for paragraph `<p>` elements, but a good use case is to use it as a class
in a `<span>` element and indent the first line of a paragraph immediately after a heading (e.g., `<h2>`) element:

```
.text-indent-example {
    text-indent: 20px; /* Indents first line */
}
```

### Text Decoration and Transformation

The [`text-decoration`][text_decoration_mdn] property adds decorative lines to our text, and
the [`text-transform`][text_transform_mdn] property controls a text's capitalization.

Since `text-decoration` adds a line, the line may be [styled][text_decoration_style_mdn] as
`solid`, `double`, `dotted`, `dashed`, or `wavy`.
The default is to underline text, but we can also use `text-decoration`
to add an [overline or line-through][text_decoration_line_mdn].
We may also color the line.

 
```
.underline-text {
    text-decoration: underline;
}

.strike-through-text {
    text-decoration: line-through;
}

.multi_decoration {
    text-decoration: overline double green 5px;
}
```

The `text-transform` takes several values for capitalization, as demonstrated below.
A good use case is to apply this to various heading elements (e.g., `<h2>`), such as making all such elements uppercase:

```
.all-uppercase {
    text-transform: uppercase;
}

.all-lowercase {
    text-transform: lowercase;
}

.capitalize-text {
    text-transform: capitalize;
}
```

## Outsourcing Fonts

As stated before, fonts are generally provided by the operating system.
Since there are different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, iOS, Linux, Android, etc),
not all fonts are available for all OSes.
OSes from Microsoft, Apple, and Google might share the most common fonts because commercial companies
pay or charge licensing fees for many standard fonts since fonts may be copyrighted.
In any case, this is why when we declare font families, we always declare `serif` as the fallback font-family
if we are using a copyrighted serif font like [Times New Roman][times_wiki];
or `sans-serif` as the fallback font-family if we are using a copyrighted sans-serif font like [Arial][arial_wiki];
and so forth.

However, we can load fonts from external sources.
One major example is [Google Fonts][google_fonts].
For example, if we want to use the [Roboto Font][roboto_google_font],
its Google Font page provides the code to insert into our HTML pages and CSS stylesheets.

## Locally Hosted Fonts

Outsourced fonts present several issues.
First, we may not know or agree with the privacy policies when using outsourced fonts.
Also, outsourcing fonts means relying on third-party services.
While these services may be reliable, they could go down.
Lastly, depending on the source used for outsourced fonts,
using outsourced fonts may requires extra bandwidth:

> The [Google Fonts Privacy Policy][google_fonts_privacy] makes an argument that using their services
> instead of self-hosting their fonts saves bandwidth.

Fortunately, we can also store and host fonts locally from within our project directory.
This offers greater control and performance and allows our desired fonts to be used regardless of a user's OS or browser.
To do this, we need to:

1. Download the font files:
    1. we obtain font files in formats like `.woff`, `woff2`, `ttf`, or `.otf` from a **trusted** source.
    2. we save those fonts to a designated `fonts/` directory in our project.
2. Define the font in our CSS:
    1. we use the `@font-face` rule to specify the font name and file path.

Finally, we might add the following to our CSS stylesheet to use a font named `CustomFont`:

```
@font-face {
    font-family: 'CustomFont';
    src: url('fonts/CustomFont.woff2') format('woff2'),
         url('fonts/CustomFont.woff') format('woff');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}

body {
    font-family: 'CustomFont', sans-serif;
}
```

> Note: Although the above example illustrates how to use downloaded fonts,
> since the `src` property takes a `url` value,
> you can use the `@font-face` rule to source remote font files.
> See the documentation for the [`@font-face`][font_face_w3] rule for more details.

If using locally hosted fonts, be sure you use fonts from **trusted** sources and fonts that have
[open licenses][open_source_license_wiki].
Just like images, text, etc, fonts can be copyrighted.
I have not vetted all these sources, but some options you may explore for locating fonts to download and use on your sites include:

- [Font Squirrel][font_squirrel]
- [The League of Moveable Type][the_league]
- [Adobe Fonts][adobe_fonts]
- [Velvetyne Type Foundry][velvetyne]
- [Open Foundry][open_foundry]
- [Font Library][font_library]
- [1001 Fonts][1001_fonts]

## Conclusion

Typography plays a crucial role in shaping how content is presented, read, and understood.
Try to select the right font family for your site visitors.
Keep those visitors in mind, always!

And be sure to use fine-tuning properties, like spacing, weight, and alignment, to enhance aesthetics and readability.

Finally, focus on the principles:
readability, legibility, hierarchy, consistency, alignment and balance, contrast, and white space.
