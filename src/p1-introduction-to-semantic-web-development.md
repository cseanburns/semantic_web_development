## Introduction

This book will serve as an introduction to semantic web development.
A more advanced semantic web development course would introduce students to RDFS, SKOS, OWL, SPARQL or more.
But this book expects undergraduate students who are new to any kind of web development,
and will therefore focus on more entry level topics:
HTML5 and its semantic elements, CSS3, and JSON-LD with schema.org.

This book is a work in progress.
The goal is to complete an initial draft between January and May 2025.
