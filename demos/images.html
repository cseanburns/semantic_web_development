<h1>Playing with Images</h1>

<h2>Basic Image with alt and title attributes</h2>

<p>The basic syntax for adding an image is to use the <code>img</code> element.
It's also important to add an <code>alt</code> attribute that describes the
image for screen readers. The <code>title</code> attribute is optional but can
be used to show a title of the image when a mouse cursor hovers over.</p>

<img src="images/puzzle.png"
  alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
  title="A wooden puzzle box">

<h2>Changing the width and height</h2>

<p>We can use the <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> attributes to
resize an image. However, it's better to change the height and width in a photo
editor, like Photoshop or Gimp, instead. This is because despite the change
here, the original file may be large, and it's better to avoid transmitting
large files over the internet when possible. We don't always know what kind of
internet connection people may have. Keep files as small as possible.</p>

<p>Changed the height to 71:</p>

<img src="images/puzzle.png"
  alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
  title="A wooden puzzle box"
  height="71">

<p>Changed the height to 142:</p>

<img src="images/puzzle.png"
  alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
  title="A wooden puzzle box"
  height="142">

<p>Changed the width to 84:</p>

<img src="images/puzzle.png"
  alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
  title="A wooden puzzle box"
  width="84">

<p>Changed the width to 252:</p>

<img src="images/puzzle.png"
  alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
  title="A wooden puzzle box"
  width="252">

<h2>Responsive design with image</h2>

<p>Using the above methods to set the size of an image is not altogether
responsive, either. In order to <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">
make an image responsive to different screen sizes</a>, we can use the
<code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> HTML attributes to list optional
size images to display depending on screen size. This allows the browser to
load different size images depending on the size of the screen. This has other
bandwidth implications. Some people may be on mobile devices, and therefore may
have slower internet connections. Using a smaller image file will cause the
smaller image to load first, and therefore, faster on such devices. The
<code>src</code> attribute is used here as a fallback device, in case
<code>srcset</code> does not work.</p>

<p>I only list two sizes here, but more could be added to adjust for different
file and screen sizes.</p>

<img srcset="images/puzzle-252w.png 252w,
             images/puzzle-504w.png 504w"
     sizes="(max-width: 504px) 252px, 504px"
     src="images/puzzle-504w.png"
     alt="A picture of a puzzle box">

<h2>External images</h2>

<p>As we've already seen, we can source an image file on another site. Be
careful not to violate copyright when doing so. Here's I source an image file
from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>We use the <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> when we want to
isolate an image as important. We might use these HTML elements in certain
kinds of documents, like news articles or scholarly papers.</p>

 <figure>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Neferefre.jpg"
       alt="A statue of Neferefre Isi, an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Fifth
       Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period"
       title="A statue of Neferefre Isi, an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the
       Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period">
<figcaption>Neferefre, Jon Bodsworth, Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Images with Styling</h2>

<p>Here I add a <code>class</code> attribute to the image specify this
particular image in the HTML and add some styling to it, like a pink border and
a shadow:</p>

<img
  class="image-style"
  alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
  src="images/puzzle-504w.png"
  srcset="images/puzzle-252w.png 252w"
  sizes="(max-width: 504px) 252px, 504px">

<section>
<h2>Background Images</h2>

<p>Background images can be applied over the background of a particular part of
a page, like this <code>section</code> here, or to the entire page using the
<code>body</code> elcodeent.</p>

<p>The code for something like that would look like
the code below. Note I use <code>url</code> and not <code>src</code> to set the
file location. The <code>url</code> here is called a <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions">CSS
reference function</a>, unlike <code>src</code>, which is a HTML attribute. We
only use <code>src</code> for <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes">specific
HTML elements</a> like the <code>img, audio, video</code> elements.</p>

<p>In the example below, I placed file in the bottom right corner, but you can
do more, including repeating an image or placing it in different locations.
See: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp">CSS3
Background Image</a>.</p>

<pre>
<code>
section {
  background-image: url(images/littlesquare.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right bottom;
  }
</code>
</pre>
