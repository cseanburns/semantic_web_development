# Semantic Web Development

This repo contains the markdown source code for a textbook on semantic web development.

The work is located at: [https://cseanburns.github.io/semantic_web_development/](https://cseanburns.github.io/semantic_web_development/)

The work is generated using [mdbook][mdbook].

Demonstration code is currently stored in a separate repository, but I'll make this more standardized at some point.
[Semantic 2025](https://github.com/cseanburns/semantic2025).
